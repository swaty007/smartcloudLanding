<h2 class="titles">Purpose of this Statement</h2>
<p class="texts">
 Invisible is committed to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will go into effect May 25, 2018 and will be one of the strictest pieces of privacy legislation globally. Since GDPR was announced, we’ve been tightening up our policies and procedures to make sure we meet these requirements, and, as a final step, we are launching new online terms to address our obligations to you. The GDPR applies to all organisations established in the EEA but also to organisations established outside the EEA, when their processing activities relate to the offering of goods and services to individuals in the EEA or to the monitoring of individuals' behaviour within the EEA. The regulation contains the most significant changes to European data privacy legislation in the last 20 years. It is designed to give EU citizens more control over their data and seeks to unify a number of existing privacy and security laws under one comprehensive law. Our customers can trust that Invisible has made GDPR a priority and has devoted significant and strategic resources toward our efforts to comply with GDPR. Invisible believes that privacy is a very important right for citizens and wishes to assure all the company’s customers that we are working hard on ensuring compliance in all areas of our business. When this statement mentions “Invisible,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the "Avora Holdings LTD."
</p>
<p class="texts">
 Within this statement we wanted to highlight to our customers the measures we have put in place to ensure compliance with the GDPR where we hold or process personal data on your behalf.
</p>
