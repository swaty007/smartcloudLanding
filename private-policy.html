<p class="texts">This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our websites, products or services, or otherwise interact with us (for example, when we collect your information during events), unless a different policy is displayed. When this policy mentions “Invisible,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the "Avora Holdings LTD." company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy. We offer a wide range of products and refer to all of these products, together with our other services and websites as "Services" in this policy.</p>
<p class="texts">This policy also explains your choices about how we use information about you. Your choices include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you.  If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our business.</p>
<h2 class="titles">What information we collect about you</h2>
<p class="texts">We collect information about you when you provide it to us directly or via our partners after your consent, when you use our Services, and when other sources (Data Controllers) provide it to us.</p>
<p class="titles-h3">Information you provide to us</p>
<p class="texts">We collect/process information about you when you input it into the Services or otherwise provide it directly to us.</p>
<p class="texts">Account and Profile Information: We collect information about you when you register for an account, set product preferences, sign-up for or make purchases through the Services. For example, you provide your contact information and, in some cases, billing information when you register for the Services.</p>
<p class="texts">Content you provide through our websites: The Services also include our websites owned or operated by us. We collect other content that you submit to these websites. For example, you provide content to us when you provide feedback or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys,  promotions or online events.</p>
<p class="texts">Information you provide through our support channels: The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with a Service. Whether you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.</p>
<p class="texts">Payment Information:  We collect certain payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services. For example, we ask you to designate a billing representative, including name and contact information, upon registration. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.</p>
<p class="titles-h3">Information we collect automatically when you use the Services</p>
<p class="texts">We collect information about you when you use our Services, including browsing our websites and taking certain actions within the Services.</p>
<p class="texts">Your use of the Services: We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our Services. This information includes the features you use; the links you click on and how you interact with others on the Services.</p>
<p class="texts">Device and Connection Information: We collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Services. This device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.</p>
<p class="texts">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Invisible use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices.</p>
<p class="titles-h3">Information we receive from other sources</p>
<p class="texts">We receive information about you from other Service users, from third-party services, from our related companies, and from our business and channel partners.</p>
<p class="texts">Other users of the Services: Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they submit content through the Services.  For example, you may be mentioned by your CRM administrator when submitting an issue to our technical support. We also receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services. Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they designate you as the billing contact on your company's account.</p>
<p class="texts">Other services you link to your account: We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate or link a third-party service with our Services.  For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Salesforce credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Salesforce profile settings in order to authenticate you. You or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, share and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services. Or you may authorize our Services to connect with a third-party calendaring service so that your meetings and connections are available to you through the Services. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service.</p>
<p class="texts">Invisible Partners:  Some of our partners help us to market and promote our products, generate leads for us, and resell our products. We sometimes receive contact information, company name, what Invisible products you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.</p>
<p class="texts">Other Partners: We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising who provide us with information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.</p>

<p class="texts">Our services are responsible for transferring data between systems using API technologies. None of that data is ever being stored on our servers or passed to any 3rd party systems.</p>
<h2 class="titles">How we use information we collect</h2>
<p class="texts">How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us.  Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p>
<p class="texts">To provide the Services and personalize your experience: We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience and enhance your productivity.</p>
<p class="texts">For research and development: We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use.</p>
<p class="texts">To communicate with you about the Services: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.</p>
<p class="texts">To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Invisible ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests. You can always opt our from our email newsletters.</p>
<p class="texts">Customer support: We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.</p>
<p class="texts">With your consent: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.</p>
<p class="texts">Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):</p>
<p class="texts">If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>
<ul class="newpricing-moreinfo-ul">
 <li>
     We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;

 </li>
    <li>
        It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;

    </li>
    <li>
        You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
    </li>
    <li>
        We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="texts">If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.</p>
<h2 class="titles">How we share information we collect</h2>
<p class="titles-h3">Sharing with other Service users</p>
<p class="texts">When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p>
<p class="texts">Managed accounts and administrators: If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, contact info, and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain. If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.</p>
<p class="titles-h3">Sharing with third parties</p>
<p class="texts">We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.</p>
<p class="texts">Service Providers: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p>
<p class="texts">Third Party Apps: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p>
<p class="texts">Links to Third Party Sites: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>
<p class="texts">With your consent: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.</p>
<p class="texts">Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Invisible, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.</p>
<h2 class="titles">How we store and secure information we collect</h2>
<p class="titles-h3">Information storage and security</p>
<p class="texts">We use data hosting service providers in the United States and Europe to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.</p>
<p class="texts">While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p>
<p class="titles-h3">How long we keep information</p>
<p class="texts">How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.  After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>
<p class="texts">Account information: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p>
<p class="texts">Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.</p>
<p class="texts">Managed accounts: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.</p>
<p class="texts">Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Invisible account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.</p>
<h2 class="titles">How to access and control your information</h2>
<p class="texts">You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>
<p class="texts">Your Choices:</p>
<p class="texts">You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator, you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.</p>
<p class="texts">Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>
<p class="texts">Deactivate your account:  If you no longer wish to use our Services, please contact our support team.</p>
<p class="texts">Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>
<p class="texts">Opt out of communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.</p>
<h2 class="titles">Other important privacy information</h2>
<p class="texts">Notice to End Users</p>
<p class="texts">Many of our products are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.</p>
<p class="texts">Administrators are able to:</p>
<ul class="newpricing-moreinfo-ul">
    <li>
        require you to reset your account password;
    </li>
    <li>
        restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;
    </li>
    <li>
        access information in and about your account;
    </li>
    <li>
        access or retain information stored as part of your account;
    </li>
    <li>
        install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="texts">In some cases, administrators can also:</p>
<ul class="newpricing-moreinfo-ul">
    <li>
        restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;
    </li>
    <li>
        change the email address associated with your account;
    </li>
    <li>
        change your information, including profile information;
    </li>
    <li>
        restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="texts">Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.</p>
<p class="titles-h3">Our policy towards children</p>
<p class="texts">The Services are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact our support services.</p>
<p class="titles-h3">Changes to our Privacy Policy</p>
<p class="texts">We may change this privacy policy from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice by adding a notice on the Services homepages, login screens, or by sending you an email notification. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>
<p class="texts">If you disagree with any changes to this privacy policy, you will need to stop using the Services and deactivate your account(s), as outlined above.</p>
