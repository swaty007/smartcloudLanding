                                Always base your strategy and tactics on the way a human brain works. In this case, if you help the prospect visualize what they're purchasing and sum it up in a concise way, it's easy for them to understand what they buy, and why. Make them literally see what you offer, as more than 90% of people perceive the world and take decisions based on the visual input data. According to research, the human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than words. So, it’s your real quickest chance to get to your potential clients’ brains and hearts.

                                Assuming that your sale will close is a powerful and highly effective technique, not only to close sales but to carry out other activities as well. The only thing you have to do is to be as uber confident as possible in your product and yourself. This technique draws on the power of positive thinking, which is so popular nowadays: you are to center on your dream come true. This technique presupposes using a phrase that assumes the close is a done deal. You can create a set of your own assertive statements to resort to them whenever necessary.  E.g. “What day do you want to receive your order?”

                                A good idea is to ask a series of probing questions during the negotiations, to eliminate all objections to buy, or try to close the sale with a question. The sales rep can address objections and gain a commitment. Asking questions is a win-win situation; questions urge people to act and help you discover whether your product appeals to your customers.  E.g. “Is there anything preventing you from agreeing to this deal today?”

                                Historians say Ben Franklin made decisions in the following way: he created a list with two columns (pros and cons) and based his choice on the longer one. If you have clients who are analytical personalities by their nature, you’ll benefit from compiling lists of your product’s advantages (and disadvantages too) in advance; then offer your customers the chance to make their own decision.

                                To entice into buying those tough customers of yours who are still hesitating, offer them some special benefit (discount, gift, bonus, attractive quotes etc.). The efficacy of the technique is based on the following psychological mechanism: people are often afraid to commit, even if they want what you offer them, no matter what it is. Just simplify for them the process of taking a decision (to your advantage).
                                E.g. "If you sign up today, I can offer 25% discount.”

                                It’s recommended to create a sense of urgency which places pressure on the prospect and forces them to make a decision about purchasing. But you are to be well-versed in timing and pacing, not to commit serious mistakes as for the timeframes your clients can operate within.

                                E.g. “This is a limited time offer that is valid till the end of the day.”
                            </p>

                                Emotions possess immense power; they can change the world. To reel your customers in, you’re more than welcome to use emotions and empathy, leaving reason in the backseat. It’s recommended to relate product benefits and the aspects of customers’ problems. Showing them that you care about their pain really helps. Put yourself in their shoes and genuinely say how you would feel and what you would like to do. Imagine you’re a doctor: instead of selling a product, focus on prescribing a solution to a problem, a pill to a pain, as it were.

This face to face overt selling when you directly push someone into buying is a real tough challenge, especially for a newbie, but cheek brings success.  E.g. “Could you please sign the agreement?”

                                There’s one more handy psychological method to close sales effectively. The procedure is the following: to introduce enticing features, then offer rejecting them for the sake of something else, perhaps more interesting. The result entails that the customers don’t want let fall what they almost had; they don’t want to lose anything on their wish list and move forward to purchase the product.
                                The phenomenon is accompanied by one more psychological impact. People love to follow the trends so to grab the attention of the potential customers you only have to tell them that your brand is popular; and then simply suggest replacing or rejecting it.
