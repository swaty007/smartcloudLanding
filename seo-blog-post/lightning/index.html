                    The long-anticipated conversion to a new user interface is finally here. The inevitability of migration till 2020 has been recently announced by Salesforce, and now many companies have a lot to worry about.

                        Some applications from the AppExchange might not be supported in the new edition. It’s recommended you check everything minutely before the migration.

                   Actually, both Classic and Lightning versions lack some great features. For example, sales and support reps heavily use such a Classic UI feature as the ability to assign tasks in Lightning to multiple users, which it’s not available in Lightning now. On the flip side, users will miss some Lightning features – Sales Path, Assistant, Kanban, Einstein Lead Scoring – in Classic UI, and so on.

                        We can consider one case study as a sample of highly successful migration.
                        T-Mobile implemented Lightning Experience and managed to reduce the number of mouse clicks to create a pricing quote. The implementation lasted more than 5 months and resulted in reduction ratio of 104 to 8.

                    <p class="text">
                        Unfortunately, time wastes in transition period can be significant. For example, in training materials offered by Salesforce, just one trail “Get started with Lightning Experience” for admins takes up 8 hours 45 minutes. So, moving to Lightning is really a hard nut to crack, but we’ll try to help you convert as painlessly as possible.

                    While changing UIs, users can naturally experience severe technical roadblocks. The main task of the Salesforce admin team in the company is to identify gaps and help users eliminate them.
                    As for pain points, we can briefly mention some of them:

Unlocking new opportunities of Lightning Experience, as compared with Classic UI, can become the final straw that breaks the camel’s back. The reason is the apprehension of some companies’ stakeholders to migrate because of the extended learning curve, the need to prove ROI etc.
