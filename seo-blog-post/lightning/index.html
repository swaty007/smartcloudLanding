                    The long-anticipated conversion to a new user interface is finally here. The inevitability of migration till 2020 has been recently announced by Salesforce, and now many companies have a lot to worry about. The main pain point is the necessity to spend extra time, money and other resources to switch UIs. So, each and every Salesforce user is worried whether the transition period can be smoothened and quickened as much as possible.
                    To make our readers’ life easier, we’ll determine pros and cons of both UI versions, discover main user pains, outline migration steps, recommend tools for better switching, and so on.

                    Everything forward will be Lightning, as Salesforce executives claim. It offers tons of benefits for businesses and will surely be embraced by every employee in every company, sooner or later.

                        The necessity to spend more time on migration. It’s an arduous process and can take up to several months or even a year getting up to speed, all in all.

                        Some applications from the AppExchange might not be supported in the new edition. It’s recommended you check everything minutely before the migration.

                   Actually, both Classic and Lightning versions lack some great features. For example, sales and support reps heavily use such a Classic UI feature as the ability to assign tasks in Lightning to multiple users, which it’s not available in Lightning now. On the flip side, users will miss some Lightning features – Sales Path, Assistant, Kanban, Einstein Lead Scoring – in Classic UI, and so on.

                            We can consider one case study as a sample of highly successful migration.
                            T-Mobile implemented Lightning Experience and managed to reduce the number of mouse clicks to create a pricing quote. The implementation lasted more than 5 months and resulted in reduction ratio of 104 to 8.

                            Unfortunately, time wastes in transition period can be significant. For example, in training materials offered by Salesforce, just one trail “Get started with Lightning Experience” for admins takes up 8 hours 45 minutes. So, moving to Lightning is really a hard nut to crack, but we’ll try to help you convert as painlessly as possible.

                    Suggestions how to solve pain points
                </h2>
                <p class="text">
                    While changing UIs, users can naturally experience severe technical roadblocks. The main task of the Salesforce admin team in the company is to identify gaps and help users eliminate them.
                    As for pain points, we can briefly mention some of them:
                </p>
                <div class="line-info-wrap">
                    <div class="line-info-block">
                        <p class="text">
                            The most burning issue is the increased amount of time consumed by the potential training for a new UI. As an option for enterprises, we recommend resorting to self-training too: to give employees enough time and freedom to explore new interface themselves.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="line-info-block">
                        <p class="text">
                            There are problems with record sharing, as Lightning has no such option. The way out (not very efficient, unfortunately) can be to switch to Classic, finish the task and return to Lightning (or employ a special component on Salesforce AppExchange).
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="line-info-block">
                        <p class="text">
                            The new interface is rather loaded with data and functions, causing low speed of operation and setting off a nervous response among sales reps. There are other connected pains: limits for number of fields and controls for a page layout (you can’t add endlessly, like in the previous UI). Besides, the proper functioning of Lightning Experience at virtual machines requires better hardware.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="line-info-block">

                            Custom JavaScript buttons are not supported in Lightning. The way out can be an alternative build of quick actions, triggers or workflow rules.

                            One can also mention some minor pains which still cause disruption of workflow and time wastes. Among them is the absence of customization for activities tabs.

                    It’s vital to define enablement plan in the first place. It helps you significantly reduce hiccups while swapping user interfaces midstream. Plus, you have to think about adequate training for your team in advance. You can employ versatile sessions, webinars, strategic meetings, face-to-face trainings and coaching sessions.

                <p class="text">
                    From now on, Salesforce intends to build new features only for Lightning Experience. There are already 200 things that you can do on Lightning. Unlocking new opportunities of Lightning Experience, as compared with Classic UI, can become the final straw that breaks the camel’s back. The reason is the apprehension of some companies’ stakeholders to migrate because of the extended learning curve, the need to prove ROI etc.
