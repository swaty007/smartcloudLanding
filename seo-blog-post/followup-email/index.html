                <p class="text">
                    Modern marketing is tough as it’s hard to get through to customers’ inboxes. The wider variety of techniques, tools and weaponry you wield, the better outcome of your battle for every client.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Some might think that writing letters is not as important as the actual sales calls or personal business meetings. They usually create generic emails for the sake of mere “checking in”, and that’s the biggest mistake salespeople can commit in follow up. Actually, written words possess great power and can render more persuasive arguments to help your addressee make a final decision on purchasing your product or service.
                </p>

                <h2 class="sub-title">Theory to go</h2>

                    There are numerous questions that pester all sales reps: “How to hook contacts’ interest? When do we follow up? How do we maintain contact without being a nuisance? What vital data can we share? How to bring your idea home to the recipient without over-wording? Why aren’t they answering me?” and so on.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    One of the simplest yet efficient answers to the above questions is the leveraging of highly successful email samples reused repeatedly to its fullest extent. Being equipped with handy and time-proven templates of follow up emails can beneficially influence the outcome of your sales efforts.
