                    1. Utilize CRM and Sales Productivity Solutions
                </h3>
                <p class="text">
                    It has become common knowledge that CRM utilization is a must for every modern-day company, be it an enterprise, medium or small-sized business. CRM system helps salespeople manage customer data, customer interactions, and automate sales processes. The comprehensive data on prospects and leads stored in your CRM simplify your life, save precious time and increase productivity.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Besides using a CRM system, there are additional productivity solutions salespeople can resort to, in order to win back more time for selling. For example, SmartCloud Connect can automate your routine activities, such as dealing with emails and multiple attachments, scheduling meetings, managing document flow, etc.
                    The solution enables salespeople to work with their customer and corporate information, without leaving their favorite applications — MS Outlook and Office 365. Every activity is performed on the fly, in time-saving mode.

                    2. Standardize Proposals, Contracts and Sales Collaterals
                </h3>
                <p class="text">
                    It’s recommended to use standardized templates that are created in advance by corresponding departments (legal, finances, marketing etc.). To avoid the situations when salespeople can commit mistakes in legal or financial documents that can have serious pecuniary implications or deplorable legal bindings, free them from doing the job that is not their own. Let them do what they know best – selling.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In this case, too, the purpose of automation can be achieved using apps that help salespeople spare time for more productive activities, besides manual routine tasks. For example, SmartCloud Connect allows using different pre-filled templates from your CRM system, while composing emails, at one click. It’s a weight off your shoulders during a buy day that is filled with writing thousands of standard letters, and it spares time for real creativity in sales.

                    Different administrative and support activities, such as proposal development, contract and billing management, consume great amounts of precious time that should be better allocated for selling as it is.
