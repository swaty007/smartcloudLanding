                <p class="text">
                    There is one day when salespeople would love to be praised for what they do for us throughout the rest of the year. It’s National Salesperson Day. Though being semi-official, this professional holiday is widely celebrated in selling companies, and it’s gaining popularity in the society at large.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The holiday is established to recognize the value of a truly professional salesperson, a so-called guru of sales. This day also recognizes the hard work performed by sales people.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    When we buy something at the store or in the market, we usually do not think about a person behind the counter or at the other side of the negotiation table. Whatever salespeople sell, it’s a very hard job, telling on health. It requires business acumen, outstanding soft skills, persistence, diligence, love for people and creativity.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    National Salesperson's Day isn’t a long-standing tradition at all. It was founded by Maura Schreier-Fleming, President of Best@Selling, in March 2000. She is an author, consultant and speaker for salesperson training. Who can know the turmoil of a salesperson life better than she does?
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    As for the date, National Salesperson Day is observed on the second Friday in December (though there are variations). This day honors the value and dedication of a professional salesperson, though it’s recommended to appreciate their hard work throughout the rest of the year too.

                    You can show your support to salespeople and appreciate those men and women who try to make the world a better place, by making us the owners of really great products. Below are some ways to pay tribute to these people.

                        <p class="text">
                            An office holiday party is a great idea (and the simplest one)! Make your favorite salespeople feel more appreciated by throwing them a National Salespeople Day bash. Invite colleagues, friends and family, VIPs who have ever bought anything from your company, delivery persons, etc. Arrange some officials to drop by and make a speech.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text">
                            Most of all, salespeople need customers. If you know a sales rep and someone who might be potentially interested in buying in bulk from him, be generous with your business and social network. There might be some magic waiting to happen, beneficial for both sides.

                        <p class="text">
                            Irrespective of what you buy, just say a simple “Thank you very much!” to all the salespeople you communicate with. They will surely appreciate it, and your gratitude will have positive impact on your physical and mental health too. If you have a favorite super-obliging salesperson, present them with a $5 gift card to say “thanks”.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text">
                            That’s the last but not the least way to celebrate the day. Salespeople will be pleased to get presents from you bought for them so considerately. For you, it might also be advantageous and instructive to occupy the other side of the ‘selling equation’ and find out how it feels.

                            This deed will remind you of how much salespeople affect our lives. For one day, try to forgo using salespeople services. You’ll be surprised on how much we owe to them yet withholding their recognition.

                        <p class="text">
                           A small-town Texas lad named Chet applied for a salesman’s job at a city department store. The store was the biggest in the world and sold everything under the sun. At the interview, the boss took an immediate liking to the boy and told him he could start the next day. “I’ll come and see how you made out after we close up,” the boss said.
                       </p>
                        <p class="text">
                           The day was long and hard for the young man, but finally it was 5 o’clock. The boss closed up the store and found the lad sitting, slumped and exhausted, in a chair. “How many sales did you make today?” the boss asked. “One,” said Chet.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">
                           “One?” said the boss, obviously displeased. “Most of the salespeople on my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day when they start off. How much was the sale worth?”
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">
                           “Exactly $101,334.53,” replied Chet.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">
                           “What? How in the world did you manage that?” asked the boss as his jaw dropped.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">
                           “Well,” said Chet, “this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium fish hook, and finally a really large hook. Then I sold him a small fishing line, a medium one, and huge one. I asked him where he was going fishing, and he said he was going down the coast. I said he’d probably need a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that fancy 22-foot Chris Craft with twin engines. Then he said his little Honda Civic probably wouldn’t be able to handle the load, so I took him to the vehicle department and sold him a new GMC 1-ton pickup truck.”
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">
                           “You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook?” the boss asked in astonishment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">
                           “He didn’t come in to buy a fish hook,” Chet explained. “He came in to buy a bottle of migraine aspirin for his wife, and I said to him, ‘Your weekend’s shot. You might as well go fishing.'”

                        <p class="text">
                            A famous art collector is walking through the city and, as he approached the city’s biggest art gallery, he notices a mangy cat lapping milk from a saucer in the doorway of a store. He does a double take. He recognizes that the saucer is extremely old and very valuable, so he walks casually into the store and offers to buy the cat for $2. The storeowner replies: “I’m sorry, but the cat isn’t for sale.” The collector says: “Please, I need a hungry cat around the house to catch mice. I’ll pay you $20 for that cat.” And the owner says, “Sold!” and hands over the cat when the collector hands him the twenty. The collector continues: “Hey, for the 20 bucks I wonder if you could throw in that old saucer. The cat’s used to it and it’ll save me from having to get a dish.” And the owner says: “Sorry, buddy, but that’s my lucky saucer. So far this week, I’ve sold 68 cats.”
